                19 years, French,<br>
                Student Web Designer<br>

            Mailys Fernandes is a young 18 year student in the second year of Webdesign at the High School Allbert Jaquard to Namur. She live and work at present in Belgium for these studies. She spends her time to look her social networks and at code.
            I am fascinated by the world of tomorrow, the future technologies. Web sites, programming are a part of it.
            Before that, she was in secondary education in the environment of the art and the visual communication multi-media, she obtained her graduate of the end of year.
            I have make numerous internships in companies of communications and others, I was able to see the world of the work, the atmosphere which reigns there.

            I know how to work in team as the only one.
            I know how to adapt myself to the environment which surrounds me.
            I am fascinated by the running, I practise it for more than 2 years now. I was always a sportswoman.
            The sport enormously helped me in the work, I was able to help to evacuate the stress, to put in perspective, to stand back on certain things.
            To get a breath of fresh air, to see landscapes, also allows me to find new ideas. By speaking about landscapes, I adore travelling.
            Of my numerous escapades, I saw things which I try to retranscribe in my creations to give a touch personal and original.
